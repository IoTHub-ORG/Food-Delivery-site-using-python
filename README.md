# Ultimate-PyFood-Delivery
Ultimate PyFood Delivery is a Flask‑based food ordering web app where customers can register, log in, browse restaurants, view menus, add items to a cart, and place orders with delivery address and contact information. It features a dark blue–orange themed UI, session‑based cart management (one restaurant at a time), order history, and a simulated payment confirmation page. The app auto‑creates and seeds an SQLite database on first run, making it ready to use immediately for demos or learning purposes.

Uses:

Great for learning full‑stack web development with Flask, SQLite, and Jinja templates.

Serves as a ready‑to‑use template for small‑scale food ordering or e‑commerce prototypes.

Useful as a portfolio project to showcase database integration, session handling, and UI theming.
